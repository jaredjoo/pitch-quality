while useful, is not something that people within baseball would ultimately be able to easily quantify how valuable one pitch is relative to another. To solve this problem, we converted our predictions onto the 20-80 scale, which is a standard baseball scale that is also a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation of 10. With this grading system, people in baseball are immediately able to say that a 55 grade pitch is better than a 45 grade pitch, as it is higher on the 20-80 scale.\n\n// Our initial attempt at converting the runs to the 20-80 scale failed however, as our model decided that certain pitch types tend to do better at reducing the number of runs scored, which led to our grades being primarily breaking balls as the best graded pitches, with off speed pitches being the worst graded pitches. Our solution to this problem was to grade each pitch relative to the pitch group that it fell into, as this would allow for us to know whether or not someone’s fastball was better than the league average fastball. By doing this, we created a unique grading scale for fastballs, breaking balls, and off speed pitches. \n\n// Player Evaluation\n// The main focus of our project was to create a tool for players and coaches to be able to utilize to improve their own performance. Once we created the pitch grades, we were able to create visualizations unique to each pitcher and their pitches to give them a sense of what they might potentially change in order to improve. We were also able to create summary tables showing off who has the highest graded pitches, which could also provide front offices the ability to identify players that are undervalued by the league and acquire them for cheaper than their true value.\n_s(Results, \"p35Ld+wdGBluoF38FH7GrJPu0jY=\", false, function () {\n  return [useStyles];\n});\n_c = Results;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Results\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","useState","useEffect","bestPitches","Table","TableBody","TableCell","TableContainer","TableHead","TableRow","Paper","TableSortLabel","TextField","makeStyles","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","useStyles","table","minWidth","tableContainer","maxHeight","sortData","data","orderBy","order","sortedData","sort","a","b","result","Results","_s","classes","playerData","setPlayerData","searchTerm","setSearchTerm","setOrder","setOrderBy","fetchData","response","fetch","text","parsedData","split","map","row","length","every","cell","pop","headers","shift","players","reduce","obj","header","index","createSortHandler","property","event","isAsc","filteredData","filter","player","player_name","toLowerCase","includes","children","style","textAlign","paddingLeft","marginTop","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","label","value","onChange","e","target","component","className","stickyHeader","active","direction","onClick","pitch_type","stuffGrade","nPitches","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["/Users/Jared/CS4664/pitch-quality/src/components/Pages/Results.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport bestPitches from \"./bestPitches.csv\";\nimport {\n  Table,\n  TableBody,\n  TableCell,\n  TableContainer,\n  TableHead,\n  TableRow,\n  Paper,\n  TableSortLabel,\n  TextField,\n} from \"@mui/material\";\nimport { makeStyles } from \"@mui/styles\";\n\n// set the dimensions of the table\nconst useStyles = makeStyles({\n  table: {\n    minWidth: 500,\n  },\n  tableContainer: {\n    maxHeight: 600,\n  },\n});\n\n// sort the data according to the fields\nconst sortData = (data, orderBy, order) => {\n  const sortedData = [...data];\n\n  // sort in ascending order\n  sortedData.sort((a, b) => {\n    let result;\n    if (order === \"asc\") {\n      if (a[orderBy] < b[orderBy]) {\n        result = -1;\n      } else {\n        result = 1;\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (a[orderBy] > b[orderBy]) {\n        result = -1;\n      } else {\n        result = 1;\n      }\n    }\n    return result;\n  });\n  return sortedData;\n};\n\n\nexport const Results = () => {\n  const classes = useStyles();\n  const [playerData, setPlayerData] = useState([]);\n  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(\"\");\n  const [order, setOrder] = useState(\"asc\");\n  const [orderBy, setOrderBy] = useState(\"player_name\");\n\n  // continuoslyu update the table with the csv\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      // gett the data from csv and conver to array\n      const response = await fetch(bestPitches);\n      const data = await response.text();\n      let parsedData = data.split(\"\\n\").map((row) => row.split(\",\"));\n      while (parsedData.length > 0 && parsedData[parsedData.length - 1].every((cell) => !cell)) {\n        parsedData.pop();\n      }\n      // extract headers and set them as keys\n      const headers = parsedData.shift();\n      const players = parsedData.map((row) =>\n        headers.reduce((obj, header, index) => {\n          obj[header] = row[index];\n          return obj;\n        }, {})\n      );\n\n      // update the state upon chagne\n      setPlayerData(players);\n    };\n    fetchData();\n  }, []);\n\n  // sort according to key\n  const createSortHandler = (property) => (event) => {\n    const isAsc = orderBy === property && order === \"asc\";\n    setOrder(isAsc ?
