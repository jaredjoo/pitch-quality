This website was built using React and deployed through Netlify. The site url is https://pitch-quality.netlify.app/.
In order to run this locally, git clone the ssh or https link, run npm run start, and a local host will open up.

### In Progress
Plan on implementing a resulting csv outputted from our machine learning model in Jupyter Notebook that displays all the players with their features and stuff grade. We hope to implement a search feature so that the user can look up a player's name and their stuff grade will pop up.
