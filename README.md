### About
Author: Jared Joo (jared7e1 and jaredjoo)
  - For some reason, I was having problems with Git on my VT CS account so I did most of the development on my private github account. Hope that's okay.

Our website displays our work on the project including the Problem, Our Approach, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning, and Results. We have an interactive table within our Results page where you can easily find and sort MLB players according to their Stuff Grade, Pitch Type, and Number of Pitches. The Results page also include links to our model codebase, website codebase, final paper, and final presentation. 

### Development
The site url is https://pitch-quality.netlify.app/. This website was built using React and deployed through Netlify. Many of the packages used were react-router-dom and NavBar for multiple component functionality. The parent component is App.js and the other components are located in its child called Component directory. For inspiration on the overall UI and NavBar animations, we used this link (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-responsive-navbar-using-reactjs/). Material UI was also another package used throughout the website for better UI.

### Running Locally
In order to run this locally, git clone the ssh or https link, run npm run start, and a local host will open up.
